# Guard-for-Power-Switch
A 3d printed guard for an important switch to prevent accidental operation

### Goal: Create a guard for an important power switch to prevent accidental operation

### Organization: Lutheran Church of the Atonement, Barrington Illinois

## Background 

During a church service shortly after Atonement returned to indoor services after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a volunteer of the Atonement technical ministry accidentally bumped a power switch for the amplifier rack during a worship service. The switch was installed in a rack panel under the soundboard, where an operator was sitting at every service. 

## Goals

  - Need a structure that prevents unintentional operation of the switch
      - Structure cannot inhibiting operation
      - Must leave the switch accessible and visible to anyone who may need to operate it (volunteers, employees, ect.) 
 - Fix must be implemented before the next service to prevent this from reoccurring 

## Design

Using Autodesk Fusion 360, a simple arched design was created to extend over the switch, allowing for access from the front, but preventing anything larger than 35mm from interacting with the switch. Several fillets were added to disperse stress from concentration points in the case of something accidentally being hung from the guard, or a collision.
Additionally, slots were created on either end of the guard so it could be screwed to the switch plate. Slots were picked so only a rough measurement would be necessary as, as the guard would not need to be precisely fit.

## Manufacturing 

The guard was 3d printed on an Ender 3 Pro in PETG for its superior strength and heat resistance compared to alternative materials such as PLA

## Reflection

The implemented solution was a success and prevents accidental operation of the switch. 
If I were to do the project again, I may spend a little longer ensuring the screws fit the guard a little better. I did not revise the design since the first revision was functional enough, and re-printing a new guard would only cost more money in development time and create more plastic waste, which is unnecessary and unsustainable.
